# pour-your-heart-out-to-the-stars
a place where you can write and let the words float up to the stars, never to be seen again

I remeber a webpage from the 00s-10s that had a starry sky as background and a textbox. When you wrote the words/letters would float up and dissapear. What was written wouldn't be saved anywhere. You couldn't even look back on what you wrote. It's was a page to pour your heart out.

I want to recreate that page.
